This project entails developing a gene-finding algorithm to detect open reading frames (ORFs) in a DNA sequence, specifically a piece of the human X chromosome. The project uses Python to combine knowledge of functions, loops, and file management, as well as gene-finding methodologies such as GC content analysis and the identification of ORFs with start and stop codons. The software will process both the forward strand and its reverse counterpart, screening ORFs based on length and GC content, and then produce a list of ORFs that fulfill the criteria.
